<h1>Hi, I’m Alex. Nice to meet you.</h1>
<h3>iOS, Mac Developer & Designer</h3>
My career as a programmer started in 2003 with Flash apps developing. In 2006 I gradually moved to development for macOS. Mac was so esthetic that made me to design. And I love it! Since then I have never stopped to work on projects as a part of team and myself. Every day I am designing and developing amazing apps for macOS and iOS, that make people happier and world better.
